# webradio-tab
An effective way to listen to my favorite webradio (which is Fip) from a browser tab


# ToDo
- Add more webradios, like :
  - Other FIP channels
  - Other radios
  
- Volume control
- Retrieve song properties (title, artist, cover image) and show it somewhere

(DONE) Only one audio object, and the script changes the source URL
