# webradio-tab
An effective way to listen to my favorite webradio (which is Fip) from a browser tab


# ToDo
- [ ] Add other radios than FIP

- [ ] Volume control

- [x] Other FIP channels

- [x] Retrieve song properties (title, artist, cover image) and show it somewhere

- [x] Only one audio object, and the script changes the source URL 

# Running
Simply open the main HTML file in a browser tab, an play the radio of your choice !

To retrieve song info from Google Chrome, install an extension allowing CORS requests (Not tested with Firefox & other browsers.)

I use this one :
