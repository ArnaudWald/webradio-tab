# webradio-tab
An ugly but effective way to listen to my favorite webradio (which is Fip)


# ToDo
- Add more webradios, like :
  - Other FIP channels
- Only one audio object, and the script changes the source URL
- Volume control at the top of the page
- Retrieve song properties (title, artist, cover image) and show it somewhere
